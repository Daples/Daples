### Hey!

My name is David, a PhD candidate at TU Delft as part of the
[UrbanAIR](https://www.urbanair-project.eu) project, funded by EU Horizon Europe.

My name is David, a second-year Master student in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft.
Currently, I am working on my Master thesis on bias-aware sequential data assimilation
methods under parameter uncertainty.

I also work part-time as an advisor at [FinCrime Dynamics](https://fincrimedynamics.com),
where have worked on the simulation engine for synthetic data generation, and supported
data-driven modeling of financial crime.
