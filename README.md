### Hey!

My name is David, a second-year Master student at TU Delft. Currently, I am working on
my Master thesis on bias-aware sequential data assimilation methods under parameter
uncertainty.

I also work part-time as an advisor at [FinCrime Dynamics](https://fincrimedynamics.com),
where have worked on the simulation engine for synthetic data generation, and supported
data-driven modeling of financial crime.
